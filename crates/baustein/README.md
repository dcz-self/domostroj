A set of abstractions for working with voxel data sets.

Attempts to extend feldspar with a set of different opinions.

Maybe goals
-----------------

- iterate over populated chunks and voxels for whatever data type
- copy-on-write world modification
- map over voxels with position supplied
- and then copy-on-write
- versioned meshes, to avoid chasing dirty events
